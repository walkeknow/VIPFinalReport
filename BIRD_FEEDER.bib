abstract="In the modern era, people are very fond of their pets. But having pets has become a problem for today's working individuals as they must leave them alone at home throughout the day and must travel very frequently. Continuous monitoring of the pets is also a tedious task for the pet owners. Some pets are even overfed or underfed due to lack of proper monitoring of the feed which results in ill-health, obesity and malnutrition. The aim of our project is to develop a smart pet feeding mechanism which dispenses the food based on user requirement so that pet's dietary plans are met. The dispenser works on the principle of IoT as it can be operated by the user from anywhere in the world.",
